            "2004 125 World Champion Andrea Dovizioso has been in MotoGP™ since an incredible rookie season in 2008, where he was top Independent Team rider and fifth overall. His first victory came at Donington in 2009 when riding for Repsol Honda, before the Italian moved to the Ducati Team following a stint with Monster Yamaha Tech 3. A key part of Ducati’s journey back to the top, ‘DesmoDovi’ is one of the hardest to overtake on the brakes – and one of the cleanest competitors in battle. After long seasons of hard work saw the bike more and more competitive and a consistent frontrunner, 2017 saw the Italian challenge for the World Championship down to the wire in Valencia after a stunning six wins across the season. For 2018, he hit the ground running to win the season opener, endured some harder races and then came back swinging - ending the year runner up once again. 2019 began in similar fashion: a win in Qatar. However, a certain Marquez turned up the wick and proved too much for everyone, with Dovizioso claiming nine podiums - including two wins - on his way to P2 in the overall standings for a third year in a row. Many fancied Dovi for the title during 2020, particularly in the absence of the injured Marc Marquez, however, there was to be no dream send off from Ducati for the Italian, who could only earn one victory during the season, at the Austrian GP, soon after announcing he was to leave the Bologna Bullets. He ended the season 4th in the standings and announced his intention to take a sabbatical from the sport. It was short-lived though, as before the start of the 2021 campaign, Aprilia announced he would test their new RS-GP in Jerez over three days in April. After completing some tests with Aprilia, Dovizioso was then called up to step in at Petronas Yamaha SRT for the final five races of 2021, with Dovizioso also signing a one-year contract to ride a factory YZR-M1 next season. The experienced Italian will spearhead the WithU Yamaha RNF MotoGP Team's efforts in 2022, hoping to rediscover some of his Ducati magic."

            "Frenchman Fabio Quartararo got his start in motorcycle racing at the age of four, moving to Spain to develop his career and proclaimed national champion in the 70, 80 and 125 categories. In 2013 he won the FIM CEV Repsol Moto3™ championship and went on to win the same title again in 2014. The previous rule against participating in the Moto3™ World Championship until the age of 16 had been repealed for the winner of the then-national crown, so for 2015 - aged just 15 - Quartararo joined teammate Jorge Navarro in the Estrella Galicia 0,0 Honda team. Impressing from the start, Quartararo was on the podium in just his second race. He repeated that in Assen after claiming pole at both Jerez and Le Mans, but unfortunately a late season ankle injury halted his progress. For 2016 he moved to the Leopard Racing team with KTM machinery, and then moved up to Moto2™ in 2017 with Paginas Amarillas HP40. After some impressive showings of pace, Quartararo moved to Speed Up for his sophomore season in the intermediate class and took his first win - and pole - at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya. His move to the premier class surprised many, but what followed in 2019 was nothing short of remarkable: seven podiums, fifth in the Championship and Rookie of the Year with 192 points. His stock continued to rise in 2020, opening up the season with back-to-back victories while securing a third in Barcelona. He lead the chasing pack in the Championship race until a sudden drop off in form cost him dearly and he slipped all the way down to eighth in the standings. The pressure was on straight away for El Diablo in 2021, replacing his hero Valentino Rossi in the factory Yamaha squad, but he didn't disappoint. Victory at Round 2 in Qatar was the springboard he needed and, despite arm pump issues in Jerez and problems with his leathers in Barcelona, he was a reformed character, keeping his cool to put together a memorable season. Four further victories, ten podiums, five pole positions all equalled his, and France's, first MotoGP™ World Championship. Can the Frenchman go back-to-back in 2022?"

            "Born in Rome and now living in the motorsport-rich Tavullia, Franco Morbidelli took the Superstock 600 title in 2013 alongside World Championship wildcard outings in Moto2™ at Misano, Motegi and Valencia. He went on to sign with Italtrans Racing Team for a full campaign in 2014 and continued with them in 2015, making his podium debut in Indianapolis. Unfortunately a broken leg sustained during a motocross training session saw him miss several races after Brno, with Morbidelli returning to finish the season but far from fully fit. For 2016 he signed with the highly successful Estrella Galicia 0,0 Marc VDS team and took an incredible run of podium finishes, ending the year just outside the top three in the title fight after an impressive campaign. For 2017, Morbidelli stayed with EG0,0 Marc VDS and came out swinging to take the first three wins of the year - in the lead in the standings during the entire season and taking the title at the Malaysian GP...from STK600 to World Champion in four years. He moved into the premier class within the same EG 0,0 Marc VDS team in 2018 and took the Rookie of the Year honours. 2019 saw Morbidelli join Petronas Yamaha SRT, picking up a solid seven top six finishes. It got even better for the Italian as a masterclass in Misano saw him take a maiden MotoGP™ win, and he added two more in the Teruel and Valencia GPs for a joint best three race wins in 2020, with two more podium finishes seeing him leap to second in the Championship standings. That form saw him among the leading contenders for title glory in 2021, but a knee injury hampered his season. Returning to action at Misano, Morbidelli partnered Fabio Quartararo at Monster Energy Yamaha MotoGP after gaining promotion from Petronas Yamaha SRT, and the Italian will be a factory Yamaha rider until at least the end of 2023."

            "Jack Miller made his road race debut in 2009 after beginning his career on dirt and debuted in the 125 World Championship soon after. Taking the 125 IDM crown on his way to full time competition on the world stage, Miller first impressed in 2013 when he proved a consistent frontrunner with Racing Team Germany. A title challenge with Red Bull KTM Ajo in 2014 saw Miller just miss out to Alex Marquez, before he made the incredible move from Moto3™ straight to MotoGP™ in 2015. After a tough rookie season, Miller took a stunning maiden win in 2016 at the TT Circuit Assen, despite a season that began with a broken leg and was then subsequently interrupted by more injury. Taking a good number of top ten results, Miller remained with the Estrella Galicia 0,0 Marc VDS team for 2017 and impressed once more before moving to Pramac for 2018 and switching from Honda to Ducati machinery. More consistent and taking his first pole position, it was a solid season for the Australian who remained with Pramac Racing in 2019 and on GP19, Miller was super impressive. Five podiums came the number 43’s way in and he continued to show his class throughout 2020, earning another four podium finishes, though that first win in Ducati colours still escaped him. A move to the factory squad was deserved and he delivered in 2021: two victories, three further podiums and fourth in the World Championship. Miller's form dipped at times during 2021, so he'll have to be more consistent if he's to fight for the crown in 2022."

            "Former Red Bull Rookies Cup winner Johann Zarco made the jump into the 125 World Championship in 2009, becoming runner-up to the title in 2011 with Aki Ajo’s team before transitioning to Moto2™. Over the next three years, he achieved six podiums in the intermediate class before moving back to partner Ajo in his Moto2™ team, winning the Championship in 2015 and becoming the first man to successfully defend the Moto2™ crown since its introduction in 2010 when he took the honours again in 2016. The first Frenchman to win more than one World Championship, Zarco moved into MotoGP™ for 2017 and made an impressive debut with three podiums and two pole positions in his rookie year. He stayed with Monster Yamaha Tech 3 in 2018 and took more podiums, ending the season as top Independent Team rider. In 2019 he made the move to Red Bull KTM Factory Racing to become part of the Austrian factory's assault on the premier class. However, after an incredibly difficult opening half the season, Zarco decided to step away from his contract at the end of 2019, but KTM replaced the Frenchman with test rider Mika Kallio from Aragon onwards. Zarco then stepped in for Takaaki Nakagami at LCR Honda Idemitsu for the final three rounds of the season, before a move to Reale Avinita Racing opened up. He represented Esponsorama Racing with aplomb in 2020, securing a podium finish in the Czech GP, and he was promoted to the Pramac Racing team for 2021. The Frenchman had a season of two halves with Pramac, starting in magnificent fashion. Back-to-back podiums in Qatar saw him lead the premier class standings for the first time, with further podiums at Le Mans and Catalunya. But arm pump woes in the second half of 2021 saw his title charge tail away, eventually finishing fifth in the standings. He remains with Pramac for 2022, his main aim to finally taste victory in MotoGP™."

            "Luca Marini, half brother of Valentino Rossi, cut his teeth racing in the Italian CIV series, ending the 2013 CIV Moto3™ championship in fourth with six podium finishes. He moved to the Spanish CEV Moto3™ series in 2014, before in 2015 he moved to the Moto2™ European Championship with the Paginas Amarillas HP 40 Junior team, taking second in just his third race. A run of aggressive rides saw him finish the year in fifth overall, and he was a regular top five contender. 2016 saw the Italian make his full time World Championship debut with the Forward Racing team alongside fellow Italian and VR46 Academy rider Lorenzo Baldassarri, where he remained for 2017. A move to Sky Racing Team VR46 for the 2018 season saw Marini string together his best year yet - claiming five podium finishes, including a maiden Grand Prix win in Sepang. Starting the season as a title favourite, Marini’s winter shoulder surgery would mean he had a difficult opening to the year. However, P2 at Mugello kick-started the Italian’s campaign, with two victories coming his way in Thailand and Japan. Marini was once again among the favourites for the Moto2™ crown in 2020 with SKY Racing Team VR46, and he lived up to the tag as he lead the chasing pack for much of the Championship. However, a nasty crash in the French GP Qualifying took its toll on the Italian as he finished P17, losing his title lead in the process. Despite battling through the injury and securing P2 in Portimao, Marini couldn’t reach the summit again and finished second in the Championship. As one of the most promising youngsters in the sport, he made the jump up to the premier class and partnered the man who edged him to the title, Enea Bastianini, at Esponsorama Racing in 2021. The young Italian found it tough at first, his big frame not suited to modern MotoGP™, but he cracked it late in 2021. A front-row start at home in Misano and a top five finish in Austria are likely to give him a boost heading into 2022 with the new VR46 Racing squad."

            "Marc Marquez became the youngest ever six-time World Champion after taking his fourth premier class crown in 2017. On the podium in his rookie 125 campaign in 2008, Marquez won that crown in 2010 before moving up to Moto2™ for 2011. After a tough start, the rider from Cervera went on an incredible winning spree and had closed the gap to Championship leader Stefan Bradl to a handful of points, before a crash in practice for the Malaysian GP saw Marquez forced to cede the fight and miss the two remaining races of the year. Problems with his vision in the off season saw surgery then finally fix the problem, and despite the shortened preparation for 2012 the Spaniard took the crown in stunning style by the Australian GP. Replacing outgoing Casey Stoner in 2013 at the Repsol Honda Team, Marquez won his second ever MotoGP™ race and incredibly took the Championship in his rookie year. Then beginning 2014 with 10 wins in a row, Marquez won that crown in Motegi to successfully defend the title. Before 2015 proved more difficult with some mistakes and too many DNFs. Losing out to Jorge Lorenzo and Valentino Rossi, Marquez began 2016 with a point to prove and took another incredible Championship title – redesigning his mentality and thinking about the long game as he put consistency at the top of the agenda. The reigning Champion then fought down to the wire against Andrea Dovizioso for the 2017 crown, with everything going down to the final round and Marquez - despite an incredible moment into Turn 1 - keeping it on the podium to break another record and take another title. He began 2018 as the reigning Champion once more and went on to make more history, taking nine wins and wrapping up the title in Japan - becoming the youngest ever seven-time World Champion. 2019 saw the number 93 take yet another step up, fighting off Dovizioso once more, as well as new rivals in Alex Rins and Fabio Quartararo, with a series of tough last lap battles. After a season of only finishing second or better in every race - bar a DNF at the Circuit of the Americas - the Repsol Honda rider went on to make it Magic Number 8, needing just 15 rounds, getting the job done in Thailand. Any hopes of another record breaking year were put on hold in 2020 however, as Marquez sustained an injury to his right humerus in the season opener in Jerez, which eventually ruled him out of the season. Thankfully, Marquez was able to return to action at Round 3 in Portimao in 2021. Slowly but surely, the number 93 regained speed and fitness and at the Sachsenring, he was back on the top step. A P2 in Aragon was followed by back-to-back victories in Austin and Misano, signalling Marquez was returning to some real form. However, a training accident caused the return of diplopia (double vision) that he suffered with in 2011. Marquez missed the last two rounds of the season, as we hopefully await to see a fully fit eight-time Champion back on the Repsol Honda in 2022."

            "A product of the Red Bull MotoGP Academy initiative, Nakagami became the youngest ever winner of the Japanese 125cc Championship in 2006, and in 2007 he entered the Spanish series under the Academy banner. In the World Championship in 2008, he achieved his best result of the year with a top ten finish at Donington and he continued in the Championship in 2009. Stepping away from the World Championship for two years, he won the Japanese Moto2™ title in 2011 and was drafted in by the Italtrans team at the Japan GP as a substitute rider. The team offered him a full-time seat for 2012, and in 2013 just missed out on a maiden race victory on numerous occasions - not least when he scored four consecutive second place finishes in the middle of the season. He switched to Idemitsu Honda Team Asia for 2014 but had a tough year, before a return to the podium with third in Misano the following year. He remained with the team in 2016 and took his first win in Assen at the Dutch GP, and by the end of 2017 had garnered eight podiums and two poles. For 2018 Nakagami graduated to the premier class to ride with LCR Honda Idemitsu, and was the best qualifying rookie with several appearances in Q2. 2019 saw Nakagami stay with LCR Honda Idemitsu on a 2018 RC213V, and the Japanese rider strung a solid season together, claiming nine Top 10s and a best finish of P5 at Mugello. Shoulder surgery ended Nakagami’s season after the Japanese GP. His fourth season in the premier class saw him improve even further, placing inside the Top 10 in every race with the exception of Teruel, where he earned a first pole position, and the Valencia GPs. Another year with LCR but it was another of missed opportunity for Nakagami. HRC's struggles certainly didn't help but crashes in key moments saw the Japanese rider end the year with two top five finishes. A crucial year lies ahead in 2022 for Nakagami."

            "2013 Moto3™ World Champion Maverick Viñales took the lightweight title in the CEV in 2010, as well as the European 125 Championship the following year, and debuted in the 125 World Championship in 2011. He won four races in his rookie year – third in the Championship and Rookie of the Year – and then took that title in 2013. As a Moto2™ rookie in 2014, Viñales was again Rookie of the Year and won four races – moving up to MotoGP™ the year after with Team Suzuki Ecstar. Another Rookie of the Year trophy followed, before the Spaniard then took Suzuki’s first race win since 2007 – and his maiden MotoGP™ win – at the British GP in 2016. For 2017, Viñales moved to Movistar Yamaha MotoGP to partner none other than Italian legend Valentino Rossi. After dominating pre-season testing, the Yamaha rider won the first two races of the year and the French GP, but the Movistar Yamaha team’s struggles with low grip then saw a more difficult latter half of the season. Viñales came third overall, and the struggles continued into 2018. It was the Spaniard who brought Yamaha's longest losing streak to an end, however, as he won in Australia. 2019 started slowly for Viñales, picking up just the solitary podium in the first seven races. However, victory at Assen then put the wheels in motion for a fantastic latter half of the season. Five podiums, including a win in Malaysia, saw Viñales claim P3 in the Championship. 2020 brought hopes of a title attack for Viñales, and he was in contention from the very beginning thanks to successive second places in the Jerez double, while victory at the Emilia Romagna GP bolstered his hopes. However, inconsistent form and an inability to follow up on promising Qualifying sessions saw the Spaniard slip out of the title race and finish 6th in the Championship. 2021, his fifth year at Yamaha, started in remarkable fashion with victory at the opening round. But the relationship deteriorated from there in unprecedented circumstances. 24 hours on from a podium in Assen, it was announced he'd leave Yamaha at the end of the season, one year earlier than planned, but he didn't even make it to Valencia. After over-revving his engine in Austria, Yamaha sacked the Spaniard with immediate effect. Rumours began to grow that he'd sign for Aprilia and, before long, that deal was announced and he was testing the RS-GP in Misano. The Noale factory handed him the final five rounds of the year to adapt to the new machine and prepare for a hugely important 2022 campaign alongside Aleix Espargaro."

In 2010 he stepped into the new Moto2™ category, ending the year ninth in the standings with an impressive victory at Estoril. Bradl was confirmed as the 2011 Moto2™ World Champion at the final round of the season in Valencia, beating Marc Marquez to the title. He joined the LCR Team aboard a Honda in 2012 for his first venture in the MotoGP™ class, which saw him win the Rookie of the Year title after some strong performances. The next year, Bradl finished on the podium from a career-first pole position at Laguna Seca, but his season ended early after he broke an ankle in Malaysia. In 2014 he did not return to the podium and in 2015 he enjoyed a new challenge with Forward Racing on the Forward Yamaha. Bradl experienced a difficult start to the season, only managing to finish in the points twice in the first nine races, with a best-placed finish of eighth at the Catalan GP. After nine races, Bradl was released from his contract at Forward Racing and took on a new challenge by joining the Factory Aprilia Racing Team Gresini for the second half of the season. Bradl would stay with Aprilia in 2016 as they brought in an all new prototype machine, but a P7 in Argentina was his best result as the German finished his final full-time MotoGP™ racing season in 16th. After a brief stint in World SBK, Bradl returned to MotoGP™ as a replacement rider for Franco Morbidelli at his home Grand Prix at the Sachsenring. Two more wildcard appearances followed at Czech and San Marino GPs for the HRC Honda team before he once again provided injury cover, this time for Cal Crutchlow in the closing two races of the season. 2019 saw him take up the test rider role with Honda, making four appearances throughout the course of the year. In 2020 he had to step up a level as he replaced the injured reigning Champion Marc Marquez after the Jerez round, with the German ending the season 19th overall. Bradl continued his injury cover during the opening rounds of 2021 in Qatar, before eventually handing back the reigns to Marquez. He didn’t have to wait long for another premier class appearance though, as he was handed a wildcard appearance at Jerez. Bradl finished the year once again covering for Marquez in Portimao and remains as HRC's Test Rider for 2022."
